# List of Tools for NPO Development

## Intro
This list was created to help developers attending [GiveCamp](http://www.givecamp.org) events find the tools they need to build software for non-profit origanizations. 

The goal is to locate and categorize tools that are free, or have a free tier significant enough to be useful to a non-profit organization. We try to avoid trial software since that is likely to simply be thrown away once the trial period is over.

## Maintainers
This list is maintained by the organizers of [AZGiveCamp](http://www.azgivecamp.org). Their judgements on the appropriateness of any content or the conduct of any contributor, are final.
